<b>Assignment:</b> <h3>Web application to manage users in a system. A simple application without any authentication is required.</h3>
<h4>One should be able to see the list of users (fname, lname, dob, city, and mobile number). Create new users, edit existing users, & delete any user. The system should store the information in a persistent data store (Database, choose the one which is more suitable for the given use case). If one stops the service and starts it again, they should be able to have the user list as it was created before the service was stopped. Use any backend and frontend technology stack, if you are using react or angular or view js make sure to follow SPA standards. If you have worked only on backend technologies, only backend layer should be sufficient for this assignment. Please make sure to provide Postman or alternative mechanism to understand and test the API layer.</h4>
